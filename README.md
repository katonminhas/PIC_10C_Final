Diver Game for UCLA Pic 10C

Project: Underwater Diver game.
My goal is to have a working diver game. 
The user would control the diver character and will attempt to collect as many pearls at the bottom of the ocean as possible before the air runs out (represented by a health bar on the left side). Each time the diver clears all the pearls of a given level, the level will increase and regenerate a larger number of items to collect than the previous level, making the game more difficult each time. In addition, Sharks will randomly spawn at different depths coming from either side of the screen that the diver must avoid when collecting the items. As the levels increase, the sharks will arise with greater frequency and swim with greater speed
The user's score will be the number of pearls they collect, shown as a ticker in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

I plan to first implement the game without any graphics using Rect items to represent the diver, pearls, and sharks. I will then replace the rectangles with the correct images.
