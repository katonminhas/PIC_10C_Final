Diver Game for UCLA Pic 10C

Project: Underwater Diver game.
My goal is to have a working diver game. The user would control the diver character and will attempt to collect as many items (treasure, gold, etc) before the air runs out (represented by a sort of health bar). Each time the diver surfaces, the level will increase and regenerate a larger number of items to collect than the previous level, making the game more difficult each time. If time permits, I will add Sharks and other obstacles that the diver must avoid when collecting the items. I will construct a scoreboard keeping track of the user's current score (represented by the level they reached or the number of items they collected) as well as the high score for the system.

I plan to first implement the game without any graphics using Rect items to represent the diver and the items, as well as any obstacles. I will then replace the rectangles with the correct images.
